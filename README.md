I use KMyMoney to organise my finances and I really like the program. However, there are a few aspects of it that, for me, are lacking. The user interface doesn't cope well on smaller screens, there is no web interface and no command line interface. Also it could be easier to input the sort of transactions that I input very regularly. 

TMyMoney aims to address some of these things. The documentation can be found at  https://davidgma.github.io/tmymoney/.
