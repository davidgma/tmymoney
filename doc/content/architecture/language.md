I used [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

```
npm install -g typescript
```

Inside a node project (created later), you will need the node types.

```
npm install --save @types/node
```

A useful place to look for other types (for other npm packages you may want to use) is [Microsoft's TypeSearch page](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/).
