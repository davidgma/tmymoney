### ngh - angular-cli-ghpages
[angular-cli-ghpages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-cli-ghpages) puts whatever static site is in the /dist folder, onto Github Pages. It's designed to work for Angular, as this creates static sites, but it works for any static site. In this project I put the documentation into Github Pages and the web client too.

Contrary to the guide on the above page, I used the following to install it:

```
npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages

ngh
```
